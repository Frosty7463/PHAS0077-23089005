This is the github repository for PHAS0077 project Machine Learning Polarizability. This repository is open to me and my supervisors only.

The Python file element.py is used for predicting the element(1-atom) polarizability for the first 36 elements in the periodic table. (up to Krypton) 

The Python file parsing_smiles.py is used to parse the input SMILES format into an array that shows the atoms, bonds and the chemical structure of the given molecule.

The Python file parsing_smiles_test.py is to test some certain cases of the SMILES input

The Python file model.py aims to use the parsed outcomes of the molecule to predict their polarizability, including model training, predicting and evaluating.

The csv file pol_training_data.csv is the data used for training the models in this project
